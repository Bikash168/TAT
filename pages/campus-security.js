                        The entire Trident campus is under constant surveillance with high-resolution cameras. The CCTV system includes 3 PTZ IP cameras, 45 outdoor Bullet IP cameras, and 122 indoor Bullet IP cameras, all equipped with infrared (IR) capabilities for optimal visibility in both low and high-light conditions.

                        The cameras feed into five (5) Network Video Recorders (NVR) with 40TB hard disk capacity, ensuring live video recording for up to 30 days. The NVRs use advanced compression methods such as H.264 and H.265 to maximize storage efficiency. The recorded footage is overwritten in FIFO (First In, First Out) order to ensure continuous storage. All videos, both live and recorded, are accessible from the control room for monitoring and evidence purposes.
