                        Through a creative visualization and understanding of the significance of research in technical institutions, our Chief Mentor‚Äîa visionary with a passion for setting up a world-class technical institution and a strong inclination for societal and industrial research‚Äîinitiated the R&D movement at Trident Group of Institutions (TGI) in 1991 with the establishment of Trident Software Pvt. Ltd. (TSPL).
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-base sm:text-lg mb-4">
                        Over the years, the desire for R&D evolved, culminating in the establishment of the Spatial Planning & Analysis Research Centre (SPARC) in 1997. Recognizing education as an integral component of technological advancement, TGI took a bold step by forming a dedicated Research Committee to drive its R&D goals. Today, the Research Committee operates under the banner of Trident Research (TR), offering world-class research, development, consultancy, and extension services to achieve excellence in education and innovation.
