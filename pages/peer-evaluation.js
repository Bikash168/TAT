                        Peer evaluation is a process of collegial feedback on quality of teaching. It is a purposeful process of gathering information and evidence about the effectiveness of teaching processes and the educational environment with a view to subjecting it to constructive critical scrutiny. It usually begins with people identifying what areas they would like feedback on, and works best where the process is reciprocal between peers. A key component of peer evaluation is peer review of current practice often based on peer observation of teaching interactions. It should always be viewed as an opportunity, not a threat, for both parties.

                        Besides, all the labs are regularly assessed by external professors and industry experts from reputed organizations to augment the implementation of quality processes.
