                    Department organizes workshops and seminars regularly for the interest of students and also organizes study tour for them to various industries and national research institutes. Professors and Technical experts are invited from various universities and industries for providing additional advanced information in the field of biotechnology for the benefits of students. Apart from rigorously drilling down the students with regular classroom delivery on academic curricula as per BPUT guidelines, the department emphasizes on making students to identify, analyze, design and solve problems related to the field of biotechnology with strong foundation on the basic science, biology and IT related application. Department not only provides good theoretical and practical concept but also motivate and help the students to prepare for various competitive examinations like GATE, CSIR-NET, IARI, etc. In general, as a part of the Trident culture, students are plugged in with the ‚Äúlearn with fun‚Äù approach to nurture their intellectual, technological and personal skills development by involving them through varieties of technical and intellectual club, and professional societies. Academic environment at Trident is sufficient enough to elicit their mindset for life long learning to maintain them as successful person that are very much necessary for success in research, industry and society.
